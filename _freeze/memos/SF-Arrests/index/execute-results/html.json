The two cannot be disaggregated in the data I leverage for this memo. I refer to the aggregate as \"arrests/citations,\" or, arrests and citations.] in San Francisco between 2018 and 2024 -- the period before, during, and after the COVID-19 Pandemic. Arrest and citation activity decreased before the pandemic, sharply dropped at the outset of the pandemic, and has been consistently low in the post-pandemic.  \n\nIn the post-pandemic, arrest/citation levels for almost every class of crime were less than or equal to levels in the pre-pandemic, except for drug sale arrests/citations, which substantially increased. The vast majority of those increased drug sale arrests/citations took place in the Tenderloin. Indeed, the Tenderloin was an exception to the trend of decreasing arrest and citation levels in San Francisco -- activity in the district increased in the post-pandemic, with drug sale arrests/citations driving the increase.\n\nAn important caveat of this analysis is that it examines arrests and citations, not *crime.* Of all crime events, arrests and citations only include those events that are reported to law enforcement and go on to produce an arrest or citation. These trends do not necessarily point to equal trends in crime, rather they point to trends in how the City and Police Department are prioritizing law enforcement resources, specifically policing. Thus I conclude that in the post-pandemic, the City shifted policing resources towards the Tenderloin and prioritized making arrests and issuing citations for drug sale crime.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Geographic concentration in the Tenderloin\n\n[@fig-tenderloin] shows that arrests/citations were geographically concentrated in the Tenderloin district over the six-year analysis period. The left-hand panel depicts the general concentration of arrests/citations in downtown police districts -- Northern, Central, Southern, the Tenderloin, and the Mission. However, viewing the geographic trends by district obscures more specific patterns illustrated at a block-level in the right panel. Arrest and citation activity along the Northern, Central, and Southern districts' borders with the Tenderloin accounted for the high numbers in those districts.\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-tenderloin .cell execution_count=15}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Geographic Trends in Arrests/Citations (2018-2024), by Police District (Left) and by Block Segment (Right)](index_files/figure-html/fig-tenderloin-output-1.png){#fig-tenderloin width=1406 height=764}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the block level, we can specifically classify **\"the greater Tenderloin,\"** the area inside of the Tenderloin plus the corners along its border streets,^[A map defining the \"greater Tenderloin\" is available in Appendix @sec-gt] as having particularly high arrest/citation activity. The greater Tenderloin represents 1\\.01% of the square miles of San Francisco, but made up 27% of the total arrests/citations in the City during the analysis period. Of the top ten street corners in San Francisco ranked by total arrest and citation activity 2018-2024, shown in [@fig-2], almost all of them were in the greater Tenderloin.  \n\n::: {#cell-fig-2 .cell execution_count=22}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Ten Corners with the Highest Arrest/Citation Activity (2018-2024)](index_files/figure-html/fig-2-output-1.png){#fig-2 width=1941 height=732}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Changes in post-pandemic arrest patterns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe onset of the pandemic and the accompanying city-wide shelter-in-place order were associated with a large drop in arrests and citations at the city level. Between February and April 2020 -- the immediate outset of the pandemic -- monthly arrests/citations decreased by 43% (-441 arrests/citations) in San Francisco. This trend aligns with prior study of the pandemic's effects on crime and policing. In a national analysis that included San Francisco and 11 other major cities, @abrams_covid_2021 found that shelter-in-place orders and the pandemic itself caused substantial and immediate reductions in many types of criminal behavior and their accompanying arrest activity.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-3 .cell execution_count=27}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Monthly Arrest Totals, City-wide, 2018-2024](index_files/figure-html/fig-3-output-1.png){#fig-3 width=1408 height=564}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n While the short-term drop in arrests and citations is intuitive to some degree, it is less intuitive that activity remained depressed for years after the onset of the pandemic.

Arrests/citations for some violent crimes -- robbery and assault -- also decreased, as did larceny theft arrests/citations. \n\nIn the post-pandemic, homicide, burglary, weapons, and drug-use[^1] arrests/citations all returned to or else never deviated from pre-pandemic levels. Their average weekly arrest/citation levels in the post-pandemic were not statistically distinguishable from the pre-pandemic.\n\nSale of drugs was the only incident category where arrest/citation activity significantly **increased** in the post-pandemic. Arrests/citations tied to the sale of drugs[^2] increased by 7.43 a week on average. It is notable that drug sale arrests/citations increased while drug-use arrests/citations seemingly did not. [@fig-city-changes] shows trends for each arrest/citation type, using a statistical approach detailed in the Methods Appendix @sec-appendix.  \n\n[^1]: \"Drug-use arrests/citations\" are defined in Appendix [@sec-drug-use]  \n[^2]: \"Drug-sale arrests/citations\" are defined in Appendix [@sec-drug-sale] \n\n::: {#cell-fig-city-changes .cell execution_count=35}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Change in Average Weekly Arrests/Citations, 2018-2020 to 2022-2024](index_files/figure-html/fig-city-changes-output-1.png){#fig-city-changes width=1515 height=509}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the post-pandemic, 73% of all drug sale arrests/citations in the City took place in the greater Tenderloin. The greater Tenderloin is also the only region in the city where arrest and citation activity returned to and in some months exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Other districts generally saw levels drop slightly, or, in the Mission's case, drop significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-all-districts .cell execution_count=42}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Monthly Arrest Totals by District, 2018-2024](index_files/figure-html/fig-all-districts-output-1.png){#fig-all-districts width=1814 height=732}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe greater Tenderloin also saw a meaningful change in the composition of arrests and citations in the post-pandemic, marked by a growing emphasis on drug sale arrests/citations. [@fig-5] shows that for most arrest/citation types in the greater Tenderloin, average weekly levels were essentially equal in the pre and post-pandemic. Drug use arrests/citations rose on their face, but the increase was not statistically significant, suggesting that the weekly totals were highly variable and not consistently elevated.  \n\nDrug sale arrests/citations saw a large and statistically significant increase, with 6\\.7 more arrests/citations a week on average in the post-pandemic. This increase is consistent with media coverage of the City's aggressive approach to drug crime in the Tenderloin. @neilson_sf_2023 also suggests that policing in the Tenderloin was more aggressive in the post-pandemic, with a particular focus on making arrests for drug sale.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-5 .cell execution_count=46}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Change in Average Weekly Arrests in the Tenderloin, 2018-2020 to 2022-2024](index_files/figure-html/fig-5-output-1.png){#fig-5 width=1500 height=509}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nI conclude that in the post-pandemic, the City shifted policing resources towards the Tenderloin and prioritized making arrests/citations for drug sale in that district. To be clear, the political and administrative focus on the Tenderloin, and particularly on drug crime in the Tenderloin, is not novel [@hartlaub_culture_2022]. However, I newly document the degree to which the City, in the post-pandemic, emphasized arrest and citation activity in the Tenderloin relative to 2018-2020 pre-pandemic trends. The gap in police activity levels between the greater Tenderloin and all other regions in the City grew considerably. This shift in policing resources could have been in response to rising drug sale crime in the Tenderloin, but further research using criminal incident data is necessary to confirm any trends in crime.\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n## Appendix {#sec-appendix}\n\n<!-- ::: {.callout-note appearance=\"minimal\" collapse=true} -->\n\n\n### Data Appendix\nI based all analysis on publicly available police incident data from the City of San Francisco [@datasf_sfpd_2024]. Of the 824\\,565 records in the incident data extract, many are duplicates or else incidents that did not lead to arrest or citation. I applied filtering to isolate the 119\\,119 records that represent unique arrests/citations between 01\\-01\\-2018 and 02\\-16\\-2024. I then filtered the dataset to isolate arrests where geographic point data is available -- 118\\,506 unique arrests/citations. The vast majority of the 613 arrests/citations with missing point data took place outside of San Francisco. The negligible arrests/citations with missing point data within San Francisco were distributed across districts proportional to their totals, suggesting that dropping missing point data did not bias arrests/citations down in any particular region.  \n\n#### Defining the greater Tenderloin {#sec-gt}  \n\nI define the \"greater Tenderloin\" by placing a small buffer around the Tenderloin shape to encompass the corners along its immediate edges. See [@fig-gt] below. The buffered area is added to the Tenderloin and removed from the adjoining districts. The Tenderloin is the only district that I apply this buffering to because no other district has such intense arrest spillover on its borders.\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-gt .cell warnings='false' execution_count=48}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![The Greater Tenderloin](index_files/figure-html/fig-gt-output-1.png){#fig-gt width=661 height=572}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Defining \"Drug use\" arrests/citations {#sec-drug-use}\nIn the arrest/citation data, there is a category, \"Drug,\" which contains all drug related offenses. I split this category into two sub-groups -- drug sale arrests/citations, and drug use/non sale arrests/citations. All arrests in the broad \"Drug\" category are also members of one of these two subgroups. I define Drug use, or, non-drug sale arrests/citations, as those drug crimes that do not contain the phrase \"sale\" in their description.\n\n::: {#cell-64 .cell execution_count=50}\n\n:::

test for examining changes in arrest activity:\n\n$$\narrests_t = \\hat{\\beta_0} + \\hat{\\beta_{1}}post_t + \\epsilon_t\n$${#eq-ols}\n\nThe estimate of interest is $\\hat{\\beta_{1}}$, which represents the average increase in weekly arrests in the post-pandemic, 2022-2024, relative to the pre-pandemic, 2018-2020. $\\hat{\\beta_{0}}$ is the average weekly arrest level in the pre-pandemic and $\\hat{\\beta_{0}} + \\hat{\\beta_{1}}$ is the average arrest level in the post-pandemic. I test the hypothesis that the average weekly arrest level in the post-pandemic was different from the average weekly arrest level in the pre-pandemic:  \n\n$$\nH_0: \\beta_{1} = 0, \\quad H_1: \\beta_{1} \\neq 0\n$${#eq-h}\n  \nI repeat the estimation of @eq-ols and test @eq-h for each arrest type, a total of 9 times, once at the city-level, and once in the greater Tenderloin. I obtain the standard errors presented in the memo via a block bootstrap procedure, with weeks clustered into four-unit groups to address autocorrelation in the week-level time series. \n\nRepeated hypothesis testing introduces the issue of *multiple testing*, where every additional test we conduct raises the probability that we made a false discovery of change [@james_introduction_2021, chap 13]. To adjust for multiple testing, I apply a Bonferroni correction to the hypothesis tests. Specifically, for a 95% confidence interval, where one would typically test with a threshold for the probability of a false positive, $\\alpha = .05$,^[ $CI = 1 - \\alpha = 1 - .05 = .95$ ] the Bonferroni correction instead tests with $\\alpha = .05/m$, where $m$ is the number of hypotheses being tested [@james_introduction_2021, chap 13]. In this case, $m=$ 9, implying a threshold $.05/$ 9 $=$ 0.0056 and confidence intervals that cover 99.44%.  \n\n#### Robustness checks\n\nOne potential issue with the modeling approach is that the Bonferroni correction can be overly conservative when the amount of hypotheses being tested is very large or sample sizes are very small. However, in this setting, where only 9 related hypotheses are being tested and the week-level time series is not especially small at $n=$ 313, the Bonferroni correction can still be an appropriate adjustment [@vanderweele_desirable_2019]. Regardless, to test if the conservatism of the correction meaningfully changes the results of the policy analysis, I fit models with and without it.\n\nI also conduct robustness checks on the standard error specification. In the memo, I present the block-bootstrap standard errors because they rely on minimal assumptions about the structure of the data. However, I present results from two alternatives -- Newey-West standard errors, and ordinary least squares (OLS) standard errors -- to test robustness of the findings.\n\nEach of these specifications are theoretically inferior to the block-bootstrap approach, but the use of mis-specified OLS is so common in practice as to merit inclusion. @eq-ols, when estimated using ordinary least squares (OLS), produces standard errors valid under the following assumptions:  \n\n1. The error term is normally distributed with constant variance and mean zero: $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$.\n2. Weekly arrests are continuous and distributed normally: $arrests \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $arrests \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$\n\nIn the context of weekly arrest totals, which are a time-series that exhibit autocorrelation, the first assumption of constant variance may be problematic. Both Newey-West estimation and the block bootstrap are robust to this issue. Arrest count data, which are typically small, positive integers, don't conform to the structure set forth in the second assumption. The block bootstrap is the only specification present that is robust to this issue. Thus, the bootstrap should be the best approach under the circumstances.\n\n##### Results\n\n[@tbl-robust-city] shows that changing testing specifications has no impact on any statistical or policy conclusions made at the City-level in the memo.  \n\n[@tbl-robust-tl] shows that testing specification does not affect core conclusions about drug sale arrests in the greater Tenderloin. However, specification does affect the conclusion presented in the memo that larceny theft, robbery, traffic and drug use arrests did not change in the greater Tenderloin in the post-pandemic. Much of this is due to the fact that OLS becomes an increasingly tenuous approach in the Tenderloin, where weekly arrest counts are often small and clustered near 0, a clear challenge to OLS modeling assumptions. \n\n- Drug use: using OLS with no Bonferroni correction yields a statistically significant increase in drug use arrests. This is a mis-specified test that does not take into account the structure of the data or possible multiple testing issues. All other tests concluded that there was no statistically significant change. Still, the effect is not trivially small, so I temper my conclusion that this arrest class did not increase and encourage further research into this arrest type in particular.  \n- Larceny theft: similarly, using OLS with no Bonferroni correction yields a statistically significant estimate, while all other tests conclude there was no change. In this case, the change is also practically negligible (less than one arrest a week). In the memo , I report no change in larceny theft arrests in the greater Tenderloin.\n- Robbery: every specification that does not utilize the Bonferroni correction yields a small, statistically significant decrease, and every specification with the correction yields no change. In this case, a next step would be using a less conservative correction for multiple testing [@james_introduction_2021, chap 13]. However, given that the effect size is particularly small, I defer to the core specification and report no change in the memo.\n- Traffic: tests present a mixed bag and a practically negligible effect size. In the memo I defer to conclusions of the core bootstrap specification.\n\n::: {#tbl-robust-city .cell tbl-cap='Full City -- robustness checks for changes in arrest activity'
