Arrest activity decreased during this period, with a steady decrease before the pandemic, a sharp drop at the outset of the pandemic, and generally low arrest activity in the post-pandemic. In the post-pandemic, arrest levels for almost every class of crime were less than or equal to arrest levels in the pre-pandemic, except for drug sale arrests, which substantially increased. The vast majority of those increased drug sale arrests took place in the Tenderloin. Indeed, the Tenderloin was an exception to the trend of decreasing arrests in San Francisco -- arrest activity in the district increased in the post-pandemic, with the increase driven by drug sale arrests.\n\nAn important caveat of this analysis is that it examines arrests, not *crime.* Of all crime events, arrests only include those that are reported to law enforcement and go on to produce an arrest. Trends in arrest do not necessarily point to equal trends in crime, rather, they point to trends in how the City and Police Department are prioritizing law enforcement resources. Thus I conclude that in the post-pandemic, the City shifted policing resources towards the Tenderloin and towards making arrests for drug sale crime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Geographic concentration in the Tenderloin\n\nGeographic trends in arrest over the six-year analysis period are shown in [@fig-tenderloin]. The left-hand panel depicts the general concentration of arrests in downtown police districts -- Northern, Central, Southern, the Tenderloin, and the Mission. However, viewing the geographic trends by district obscures more specific patterns illustrated at a block-level in the right panel. High arrest numbers in the Northern, Central, and Southern districts were driven by arrests taking place along those regions' borders with the Tenderloin.\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-tenderloin .cell execution_count=18}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Geographic Trends in Arrests (2018-2024), by Police District (Left) and by Block Segment (Right)](index_files/figure-html/fig-tenderloin-output-1.png){#fig-tenderloin}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the block level, we can specifically classify **\"the greater Tenderloin,\"** the area inside of the Tenderloin plus the corners along its border streets,^[A map defining the \"greater Tenderloin\" is available in Appendix @sec-gt] as having particularly high arrest activity. Arrests in the greater Tenderloin made up 27% of the total arrests in San Francisco in the analysis period. Of the top ten street corners in San Francisco ranked by total arrest activity 2018-2024, shown in [@fig-2], almost all of them were in the greater Tenderloin.  \n\n::: {#cell-fig-2 .cell execution_count=24}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Ten Corners with the Highest Arrest Activity (2018-2024)](index_files/figure-html/fig-2-output-1.png){#fig-2}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Changes in post-pandemic arrest patterns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe onset of the pandemic and the accompanying city-wide shelter-in-place order were associated with a large drop in arrests at the city level. Between February and April 2020 -- the immediate outset of the pandemic -- monthly arrests decreased by 43% (-441 arrests) in San Francisco. This trend aligns with prior study of the pandemic's effects on crime and policing. In a national analysis that included San Francisco and 11 other major cities, @abrams_covid_2021 found that shelter-in-place orders and the pandemic itself caused substantial and immediate reductions in many types of criminal behavior and their accompanying arrest activity.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-3 .cell execution_count=29}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Monthly Arrest Totals, City-wide, 2018-2024](index_files/figure-html/fig-3-output-1.png){#fig-3}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n While the short-term drop in arrests is intuitive to some degree, it is less intuitive that arrest activity remained depressed for years after the onset of the pandemic.

Arrests for some violent crimes -- robbery and assault -- also decreased, as did larceny theft arrests. \n\nIn the post-pandemic, homicide, burglary, weapons, and drug-use[^1] arrests all returned to or else never deviated from pre-pandemic levels, with average weekly arrest levels in the post-pandemic indistinguishable from the pre-pandemic. All trends are shown in [@fig-city-changes], using a statistical approach detailed in the Appendix @sec-stats.\n\nThe only incident category examined where arrest activity significantly increased in the post-pandemic was arrest tied to the sale of drugs,[^2] up by 7.43 arrests a week on average. It is notable that drug sale arrests increased while drug-use arrests did not.  \n\n[^1]: \"Drug-use arrests\" are defined in Appendix [@sec-drug-use]  \n[^2]: \"Drug-sale arrests\" are defined in Appendix [@sec-drug-sale] \n\n::: {#cell-fig-city-changes .cell execution_count=37}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Change in Average Weekly Arrests, 2018-2020 to 2022-2024](index_files/figure-html/fig-city-changes-output-1.png){#fig-city-changes}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe vast majority, 73%, of those elevated drug sale arrests in the post-pandemic took place in the greater Tenderloin. The greater Tenderloin is also the only region in the city where arrest activity returned to and in some months exceeded pre-pandemic levels. Other districts generally saw arrest levels drop slightly, or, in the Mission's case, drop significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-all-districts .cell execution_count=43}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Monthly Arrest Totals by District, 2018-2024](index_files/figure-html/fig-all-districts-output-1.png){#fig-all-districts}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe greater Tenderloin also saw a meaningful change in the composition of arrests in the post-pandemic, with a growing emphasis on drug sale arrests. [@fig-5] shows that for most arrest types in the greater Tenderloin, average weekly arrest levels were essentially equal in the pre and post pandemic. While drug use arrests rose on their face, the increase was not statistically significant, due to the weekly arrest totals being highly variable and not consistently elevated.  \n\nDrug sale arrests saw a significant and large increase, with 6\\.7 more arrests a week on average in the post-pandemic than the pre period. This increase is consistent with media coverage of the City's approach to drug crime in the Tenderloin -- @neilson_sf_2023 suggests that policing in the Tenderloin was more aggressive in the post-pandemic, with a particular focus on making arrests for drug sale and facing political pressure to avoid making arrests for drug use.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-5 .cell execution_count=47}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Change in Average Weekly Arrests in the Tenderloin, 2018-2020 to 2022-2024](index_files/figure-html/fig-5-output-1.png){#fig-5}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Discussion\n\nI conclude that in the post-pandemic, the City shifted policing resources towards the Tenderloin and towards making arrests for drug sale, the vast majority of which took place in the Tenderloin. To be clear, political and administrative focus on the Tenderloin, and particularly on drug crime in the Tenderloin, is not novel [@hartlaub_culture_2022]. However, I find that the degree to which the City, in the post-pandemic, has emphasized arrest activity in the Tenderloin, is novel. The arrest gap between the greater Tenderloin and all other regions in the City has grown considerably. This shift in policing resources may be in response to rising drug sale crime in the Tenderloin, but further research using criminal incident data is necessary to confirm any trends in crime.\n\n## Data appendix\nAnalysis is based on publicly available police incident data from the City of San Francisco [@datasf_sfpd_2024]. Of the 824\\,565 records in the incident data extract, many are duplicates or else incidents that did not lead to arrest. Filtering is applied to isolate the 119\\,119 records that represent unique arrests between 01\\-01\\-2018 to 02\\-16\\-2024. The dataset is then filtered to isolate arrests where geographic point data is available -- 118\\,506 unique arrests. he vast majority of the 613 arrests with missing point data were arrests that took place outside of San Francisco, with the negligible missing-ness for arrests in San Francisco distributed across districts proportional to their arrest totals.\n\n#### Defining the greater Tenderloin {#sec-gt}  \n\nThe \"greater Tenderloin\" is defined by placing a small buffer around the Tenderloin shape to encompass the corners along its immediate edges. See [@fig-gt] below:\n\n\n\n::: {#cell-fig-gt .cell warnings='false' execution_count=49}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![The Greater Tenderloin](index_files/figure-html/fig-gt-output-1.png){#fig-gt}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Defining \"Drug use\" arrests {#sec-drug-use}\nIn the arrest data, there is an arrest type, \"Drug,\" which is defined broadly and contains all drug related offenses. I split this category into two sub-groups -- drug sale arrests, and drug use/non sale arrests. All arrests in the broad \"Drug\" category are also members of one of these two subgroups.  \nDrug use, or, non-drug sale arrests, are defined as those drug crimes that do not contain the phrase \"sale\" in their description.\n\n::: {#cell-65 .cell execution_count=51}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=83}\n```{=html}\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n</style>\n<table

\\hat{\\beta_{1}}post_t + \\epsilon_t\n$${#eq-ols}\n\nThe estimate of interest is $\\hat{\\beta_{1}}$, which represents the average increase in weekly arrests in the post-pandemic, 2022-2024, relative to the pre-pandemic, 2018-2020. $\\hat{\\beta_{0}}$ is the average weekly arrest level in the pre-pandemic and $\\hat{\\beta_{0}} + \\hat{\\beta_{1}}$ is the average arrest level in the post-pandemic. I test the hypothesis that the average weekly arrest level in the post-pandemic was different from the average weekly arrest level in the pre-pandemic:  \n\n$$\nH_0: \\beta_{1} = 0, \\quad H_1: \\beta_{1} \\neq 0\n$${#eq-h}\n  \nI repeat the estimation of @eq-ols and test @eq-h for each arrest type, a total of 9 times.  \n\nTo adjust for multiple testing, I apply a bonferroni correction to the hypothesis tests. Specifically, for a 95% confidence interval, where one would typically test with a threshold for the probability of a false positive, $\\alpha = .05$,^[$CI = 1 - \\alpha = 1 - .05 = .95$] the bonferroni correction implies instead testing with $\\alpha = .05/m$, where $m$ is the number of hypotheses being tested. In this case, $m=$ 9, implying a threshold $.05/$ 9 $=$ 0.0056 and confidence intervals that cover 99.44%.  \n\n#### Robustness checks\n\nThe bonferroni correction has been criticized as being overly conservative when the amount of hypotheses being tested is very large or sample sizes are very small, but in this setting, where only 9 related hypotheses are being tested and the week-level time series is fairly large at $n=$ 313, the bonferroni correction should be an appropriate adjustment [@vanderweele_desirable_2019]. Regardless, to test if the conservatism of the correction meaningfully changes the results of the policy analysis, I fit models with and without it. The correction has no effect on estimates that are ascribed policy-relevance in the memo, but does makes a difference for Robbery and Traffic arrests in the Tenderloin, which, without the correction, have statistically significant, small, decreases, and with the correction have no statistically significant change. These findings are not relevant for the core findings of the memo. \n\nNote that @eq-ols is estimated under the assumption that the error term is normally distributed with constant variance and mean zero: $\\epsilon \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma^2)$. In the context of weekly arrest totals, which are a time-series that exhibit autocorrelation, the assumption of constant variance may be problematic. Estimation is repeated using autocorrelation-robust Newey-West estimation, which appropriately adjust standard errors, and using a nonparametric block bootstrap, which does not make any assumptions regarding the distributions of the error term. Neither of these specifications change the memo's findings.\n\n@eq-ols is also estimated under the assumption that arrests of each type are continuous and distributed normally: $arrests \\in \\mathbb{R}$ and $arrests \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$, neither of which are necessarily true for arrest count data, which are typically small, whole integers. The block bootstrap specification makes no assumptions about the distribution of the outcome and consistently reaches the same policy conclusions as @eq-ols. Specification does not change the core findings.\n\n::: {#tbl-robust-city .cell tbl-cap='Full City -- robustness checks for changes in arrest activity' execution_count=53}\n\n::: {.cell-output
