The following are my notes on how to use American Community Survey (ACS)
microdata, leveraging the University of Minnesota's Integrated Public
Use Microdata Series (IPUMS).[^1] I cover:

[^1]: I want to note that several of the points I cover here are things
    I learned from some coworkers-- [Bert
    Wilden](https://www.bwilden.com/) and Stephanie Peng.

1.  **Retrieval**: how to choose which ACS product is relevant, how to
    submit a request to IPUMS, and how to filter down to relevant levels
    of geography/granularity.
2.  **Analysis**: how to properly weight ACS data using sample and
    replication weights for accurate analysis and uncertainty
    estimation.

I'll start with a motivating question:  

::: {.callout-tip}
## Motivating Question
**What was the median household
income in Oakland, California in 2022?**  
:::

## Aggregate data with `tidycensus`

Answering that question is straightforward using the Census' *aggregate*
data -- pre-calculated descriptive statistics for aggregate geographies.
I typically retrieve aggregate data via the [Census
API](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/data-via-api.html).[^2]
In R, the `tidycensus` package provides an easy-to-use wrapper for that
API. Note that I set up an API key for the U.S. Census and I'm storing
it in my `.Renviron` file as `census_api_key="yourkeyhere"`.

[^2]: For an informal analysis, I might just use a web-based tool like
    [Census Reporter](https://censusreporter.org/) to quickly look
    something up.

```{r}
#| output: false
#| warning: false
census_api_key(Sys.getenv("census_api_key"))
```

I query `B19013_001`, the median household income variable, using the
2022 1-year American Community Survey sample and I filter down to
Oakland's GEOID, `0653000`, which is a combination of the state code for
California, `06`, and the place code for Oakland, `53000`.[^3] I'll
throw in the total population variable for good measure:

[^3]: See the [full variable list for the 2022 1-year
    ACS](https://api.census.gov/data/2022/acs/acs1/variables.html) for
    the available variables, and see the [Census Place
    table](https://www.census.gov/library/reference/code-lists/ansi.html#place)
    for looking up GEOIDs

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| label: tbl-agg-data
#| tbl-cap: "Total Population and Median Household Income in Oakand, CA via Aggregate Data"
oakland_stats <- get_acs(
  geography = "place",
  variables = c(
    median_hh_income = "B19013_001",
    total_pop = "B17001_001"
  ),
  state = "CA",
  year = 2022,
  survey = "acs1"
)
oakland_stats <- oakland_stats %>% filter(GEOID == '0653000')
oakland_stats %>% select(c(variable, estimate, moe))
```

Done! We now know the population and median household income for Oakland
in 2022, along with a margin of error. See [@walker_analyzing_2023] for
a comprehensive treatment of working with aggregate census data.

## Microdata with IPUMS/`ipumsr`

What if I wanted to have access to the underlying data used to calculate
the median? Maybe I want to try a different standard error specification
for that statistic, or calculate other statistics, like the average
household income. These tasks would all entail accessing census
*microdata* -- household and/or individual level census data.

One of the most popular sources for downloading census microdata is the
University of Minnesota's Integrated Public Use Microdata Series
(IPUMS). The IPUMS team provides a centralized API for downloading
census microdata, comprehensive documentation for working with the data,
and harmonized variables across time [@walker_analyzing_2023, chapter
9].

The easiest way to access IPUMS data in R is with the
[`ipumsr`](https://tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/) package, which the IPUMS
team maintains and which allows users to submit API requests to IPUMS
directly from R [@greg_freedman_ellis_ipumsr_2024] . To get set up, I
[registered for an IPUMS API
key](https://developer.ipums.org/docs/v2/get-started/), stored the key
in my `.Renviron` file, and will configure the key in `ipumsr` as
follows:

```{r}
#| output: false
set_ipums_api_key(Sys.getenv("ipums_api_key"))
```

The `ipumsr` website [provides
details](https://tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/articles/ipums.html#obtaining-data-via-the-ipums-api)
on what survey products the project currently supports, as does the
`ipums_data_collections()` function:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-ipums-available
#| tbl-cap: "IPUMS API Collections"
ipums_data_collections() %>%
  filter(api_support == TRUE) %>% 
  arrange(desc(collection_type))
```

I'll look at IPUMS USA since my motivating question involves median
household income for a year (2022), and IPUMS USA offers annual data
from decennial censuses 1790-2010 and American Community Surveys (ACS)
2000-present [@ruggles_ipums_2024]. We can check out the newest products
they have in the USA collection as follows:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-acs-datasets
#| tbl-cap: "IPUMS USA Products"
get_sample_info(collection="usa") %>%
  arrange(desc(name)) %>%
  head(5)
```

Note that "PRCS" refers to the Puerto Rico Community Survey (an ACS
equivalent specifically tailored to Puerto Rico). We are principally
interested in the ACS, which comes in either one-year (e.g. 2023 ACS) or
five-year (e.g. 2018-2022, ACS 5-year) estimates. The differences
between these two estimates are described in detail in [Census Data: An
Overview](https://walker-data.com/census-r/the-united-states-census-and-the-r-programming-language.html#census-data-an-overview)
in [@walker_analyzing_2023]. One differentiating point is that one-year
estimates come from a smaller, but more contemporary sample. In our case
we'll use the one-year to get the best sense of the 2022 income
dynamics.

Let's return to the motivating question for this post:  

::: {.callout-tip}
## Motivating Question
**What was the median household
income in Oakland, California in 2022?**  
:::

To answer that we will:

1.  Get income data from the 2022 1-year ACS (@sec-step-1).
2.  Filter our data down to households in the city of Oakland
    (@sec-step-2 and @sec-step-3).
3.  Calculate the median (@sec-step-4 and @sec-step-5).

## Step 1: Retrieving data {#sec-step-1}

For the first task, I'll define several helper functions:

-   `retrieve_sample()` retrieves a list of variables from a given ACS
    sample from the IPUMS API. This is the only truly necessary code.
-   `check_description()` and `ipums_data()` are functions for checking
    if the target extract already exists locally. Retrieving an extract
    can take some time, and I'd like to avoid doing it repeatedly when
    I've already downloaded the extract in the past.

Each of these are defined in the following folded code block.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
retrieve_sample <- function(sample, variables, description) {
  extract <- define_extract_micro(
    description = description,
    collection = "usa",
    samples = c(sample),
    variables = variables
  )
  data_path <- extract %>%
    submit_extract() %>%
    wait_for_extract() %>%
    download_extract(download_dir = here::here("data"),
                     overwrite = TRUE)
  data <- read_ipums_micro(data_path)
  return(data)
}

check_description <- function(file, description) {
  xml_text <- readLines(file, warn = FALSE) %>% paste(collapse = "\n")
  user_description <- str_match(xml_text, "User-provided description:\\s*(.*)]]")[, 2]
  # Check if it matches the target
  if (str_detect(user_description, fixed(description, ignore_case = TRUE))) {
    return(file)
  } else {
    return(NULL)
  }
}

ipums_data <- function(sample, variables, description) {
  local_ipums_extracts <- list.files(
    path = here::here('data'),
    pattern = "\\.xml$",
    full.names = TRUE
  )
  matching_files <- compact(map(local_ipums_extracts, \(x) check_description(x, description)))
  # If there is a match, open the first matching file
  if (length(matching_files) > 0) {
    matched_file <- matching_files[[1]]
    message("Opening: ", matched_file)
    data <- read_ipums_micro(matched_file)
  } else {
    message("No matching dataset found.")
    data <- retrieve_sample(sample, variables, description)
  }
}
```

I'll proceed to define a list of variables that I want, including
`HHINCOME` (household income) and `INCTOT` (individual income). Some of
these variables refer to census-specific language – i.e. `PUMA` ,
`REPWT` , `REPWTP`. I'll cover exactly what each of these represent
later in the post, but in the meantime I'll also note that the IPUMS
website has [full reference
materials](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group) for all
available variables.

```{r}
variables <- list(
  "PUMA",
  "AGE",
  "SEX",
  "EDUC",
  "HHINCOME",
  "INCTOT",
  "REPWT",
  "REPWTP",
  var_spec("STATEFIP",
           case_selections = "06")
)
```

Note the line, `var_spec("STATEFIP", case_selections = "06")`. This
selects the variable `STATEFIP`, while also specifying that we want to
restrict our request to data where `STATEFIP=='06'` (California). Using
[`var_spec()`](https://tech.popdata.org/ipumsr/reference/var_spec.html)
is important, as accidentally/unnecessarily downloading an unfiltered,
full sample of the entire U.S. is time-consuming.

Anyways, I can request these variables from the 2022 1-year ACS via
my`ipums_data()` function.

```{r}
#| output: false
data <- ipums_data("us2022a", variables, "Incomes by PUMA")
```

Here are the resulting data, the 2022 1-year ACS for California.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-raw
#| tbl-cap: "Unfiltered 2022 1-year ACS data for California"
data %>% head()
```

## Step 2: Using Geocorr to identify small geographies {#sec-step-2}

We now have microdata for all of California, but we need to filter down
to just Oakland. Unfortunately, this isn't as simple as just running
`filter(CITY == 'Oakland')` -- ACS microdata does not include a field
for explicitly identifying cities (note that a city is typically
referred to as a "place" in census data).

The smallest geographic area explicitly identified in the microdata is
something called a public use microdata area (PUMA) [@pastoor_how_2024].
PUMAS are unique geographies that always aggregate to the state-level
(e.g. California can be constructed with a collection of PUMAs), but
only sometimes aggregate to other small geographic areas, such as city,
metro area, and county [See [Census
Hierarchies](https://walker-data.com/census-r/the-united-states-census-and-the-r-programming-language.html#census-hierarchies)
in @walker_analyzing_2023, chapter 1].

```{r fig.asp = .6}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-cap: "Places and PUMAS in the Bay Area (region border in red)"
#| warning: false

library(tigris)
library(sf)

options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)

bay_area_counties <- c(
  "Alameda", "Contra Costa", "Marin", "Napa",
  "San Francisco", "San Mateo", "Santa Clara", "Solano", "Sonoma"
)

bay_area <- counties(state = "CA", class = "sf", year=2022) %>%
  filter(NAME %in% bay_area_counties) %>%
  st_union()  # Merge counties into a single boundary

# Get all California Places & PUMAs
places <- places(state = "CA", class = "sf", year=2022)
pumas <- pumas(state = "CA", class = "sf",  year=2022)
# Filter only those in the Bay Area

pumas_bay <- pumas[st_intersects(pumas, bay_area, sparse = FALSE), ]

pumas_bbox <- st_bbox(bay_area)

    panel.spacing = unit(0, "lines"),      
    plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0, "cm")
)

map_places <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = places_bay, fill = "lightblue", color = "darkgrey", size = 0.1) +
  geom_sf(data = bay_area, fill = NA, color = "red", size = 4) +  
  coord_sf(ylim = c(pumas_bbox["ymin"], pumas_bbox["ymax"]), xlim = c(pumas_bbox["xmin"], pumas_bbox["xmax"]), expand=FALSE) +  # Apply PUMAs y-limits
  crop_theme +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Places")

map_pumas <- ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = pumas_bay, fill = "lightblue", color = "darkgrey", size = 0.1) +
  geom_sf(data = bay_area, fill = NA, color = "red", size = 4) +  
  coord_sf(ylim = c(pumas_bbox["ymin"], pumas_bbox["ymax"]), xlim = c(pumas_bbox["xmin"], pumas_bbox["xmax"]), expand=FALSE) +  # Ensure y-axis is the same
  crop_theme +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("PUMAs")


plot_grid(map_places, map_pumas, nrow = 1, align = "h", axis="t", vjust = 0)

```

To find out if a city corresponds to a collection of PUMAs and which
PUMAs those are, we'll use
[Geocorr](https://mcdc.missouri.edu/applications/geocorr2022.html)
(geographic correspondence engine), an application that generates
correlation lists showing relationships between two or more geographic
coverages in the United States [@mihalik_missouri_2022]. Geocorr is a
sponsored program of the Missouri State library and published by the
University of Missouri Center for Health Policy.[^4]

[^4]: I'll to note that the combination of IPUMS and Geocorr is a
    fantastic public good, and it's extremely generous of the public
    Universities of Minnesota and Missouri to publish these.

![Geocorr 2022: Geographic Correspondence
Engine](geocorr.png){width="80%"}

To use Geocorr, I'll define a function, `geocorr_2022()` that queries
Geocorr 2022 and retrieves a .csv file establishing the relationships
between two sets of geographies within a given state. See the following
folded code chunk for the specifics:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
geocorr_2022 <- function(state, geo_1, geo_2, weight_var) {
  base_url <- "https://mcdc.missouri.edu"
  params <- glue(
    "cgi-bin/broker?_PROGRAM=apps.geocorr2022.sas&",
    "_SERVICE=MCDC_long&_debug=0&",
    "state={state}&g1_={geo_1}&g2_={geo_2}&wtvar={weight_var}&",
    "nozerob=1&fileout=1&filefmt=csv&lstfmt=txt&title=&",
    "counties=&metros=&places=&oropt=&latitude=&longitude=&",
    "distance=&kiloms=0&locname=")
  initial_url <- params %>% url_absolute(base = base_url)
  initial_response <- GET(initial_url)
  html_content <- content(initial_response, as = "text")
  parsed_html <- read_html(html_content)
  # Extract the one link
  csv_url <- parsed_html %>%
    html_node("a") %>%
    html_attr("href") %>%
    stringr::str_trim() %>%
    url_absolute(base = base_url)
  csv_data <- read_csv(csv_url)
  return(csv_data)
}
```

We'll use that function to establish the relationships between
California's 2022 PUMAs and its "places," using individual population as
measured in the 2020 Decenial Census to weight the relationships.

```{r}
#| output: false
csv_data <- geocorr_2022("Ca06", "puma22", "place", "pop20")
```

With that, we can see which PUMAs correspond to the City of Oakland.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-correspondence
#| tbl-cap: "PUMA to Place correspondence for Oakand, CA"
csv_data %>%
  select(-c(state, stab, place, PUMA22name)) %>%
  filter(PlaceName == 'Oakland city, CA')
```

The `AFACT` (allocation factor) column shows the proportion of the
source area contained in the target area -- in this case the proportion
of the PUMA population that belongs to Oakland. In this case, 100% of
the populations in PUMAs 111, 112, 113, and 123 belong to Oakland, and
0% of PUMA 114. GEOCORR does believe that 9 individuals from 114 live in
Oakland, but based on the AFACT of 0 and the fact that I know the PUMA
overlays the neighboring city of Piedmont, I'll feel comfortable
dropping that PUMA.[^5]

[^5]: Were the AFACT higher, e.g. 1%, I could randomly sample 1% of the
    individuals from that PUMA and include them in my Oakland sample.

Note that when you plot place to PUMA equivalence, you may find slight
differences due to the fact that places can include un-populated areas,
such as bodies of water [in the case of
Oakland](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oakland,+CA/@37.7831602,-122.3045548,11z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x80857d8b28aaed03:0x71b415d535759367!8m2!3d37.8043514!4d-122.2711639!16zL20vMGRjOTU?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDIxMi4wIKXMDSoJLDEwMjExNDU1SAFQAw%3D%3D).

  theme_minimal() +
  crop_theme +
  ggtitle("Oakland (PUMAs)")

plot_grid(map_places, map_pumas, nrow = 1, align = "h", axis = "t", vjust = 0)

```

Filtering to those PUMAs gets us the 2022 1-year ACS microdata for the
City of Oakland (I use `haven::zap_labels()` just to remove some
unnecessary formatting that comes with the data).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-oakland-raw
#| tbl-cap: "2022 1-year ACS data for Oakland, CA"
oakland_pumas <- c(111, 112, 113, 123)
oak <- data %>%
  filter(PUMA %in% oakland_pumas) %>% 
  haven::zap_labels()
oak %>% head()
```

## Step 3: Specify the unit of analysis {#sec-step-3}

Each row in the ACS microdata represents an individual, identified by a
unique combination of `SAMPLE`, which defines the year when the
individual was surveyed, `SERIAL`, a unique identifier for that
individual's household, and `PERNUM`, a unique identifier for the
individual within their household [@ruggles_ipums_2024]. Given that, we
can define a straightforward definition for unique individuals in the
ACS:

-   **Individuals**: The combination of `SAMPLE`, `SERIAL`, and `PERNUM`
    provides a unique identifier for every person in the IPUMS. ACS
    microdata is typically individual-level, so this filtering should
    not be necessary.

Defining a household is slightly more complex.

-   **Housing Units**: The combination of `SAMPLE` and `SERIAL` provides
    a unique identifier for every housing unit in the IPUMS. However,
    this includes both households and general group quarter housing,
    e.g. correctional facilities. Housing units are further categorized
    using the
    [`GQ`]((https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/GQ#description_section))
    variable.
    -   **Households**: Non group quarter housing units, defined by
        filtering housing units to those where `GQ`, is 1 or 2
        [@bloem_matching_2018]. The [comparability
        section](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/GQ#comparability_section)
        of the `GQ` variable documentation explains this choice in
        greater detail, but in short it represents non-institutional
        housing-units where 9 or fewer people unrelated to the
        head-of-household reside.

We can group/filter by these variable combinations and see how many
individuals, housing units, and households were surveyed across PUMAs in
Oakland for the 2022 1-year ACS.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-granularity
#| tbl-cap: "Oakland Dataset Granularity by PUMA"
oak %>%
  group_by(PUMA) %>%
  summarise(
    n_rows = n(),
    n_individuals = n_distinct(SAMPLE, SERIAL, PERNUM),
    n_housing_units = n_distinct(SAMPLE, SERIAL)) %>%
  inner_join(oak %>%
               filter(GQ <= 2) %>%
               group_by(PUMA) %>%
               summarise(n_households = n_distinct(SAMPLE, SERIAL)),
             by = join_by(PUMA))
```

We see that each row in the data represents an individual (`n_rows`
equals `n_individuals`) and, as we would expect, the number of housing
units and households are successively lower than the number of
individuals.

### Households, group quarters, and institutions

So, given that our motivating question concerns household income, we can
apply the following filtering, per [@bloem_matching_2018], and isolate just the heads of all the households in Oakland.

```{r}
households <- oak %>%
  filter(
    PERNUM == 1,
    GQ <= 2
    )
```

But to build a little intuition around that selection, let's also look at what different housing units look like, and *why* the household definition is restrictive.  

#### A household
I'll randomly select a household in the data to see what such a unit
looks like in practice.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-example-hh
#| tbl-cap: "An example household with income data"
#| code-fold: true

household_serials <- oak %>%
  filter(GQ <= 2) %>%
  group_by(SERIAL) %>%
  count() %>%
  filter(n > 1) %>%
  pull(SERIAL)
set.seed(5)
sample_household_true <- sample(household_serials, 1)
n <- oak %>% filter(SERIAL == sample_household_true) %>% dim() %>% .[1]
oak %>% filter(SERIAL == sample_household_true) %>% 
  select(c(SERIAL, GQ, PERNUM, RELATE, AGE, SEX, HHINCOME, INCTOT))
```

This household, with `SERIAL`
`{r} format(sample_household_true, scientific=FALSE)` has `{r} n`
members, each with a unique `PERNUM`. To identify household members'
relationship to the head-of-household, [we reference
`RELATE`](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/RELATE#codes_section).
The first row, where `RELATE==1` denotes a 41 year old female (`SEX==2`)
head-of-household. The second, where `RELATE==2` denotes their spouse,
in this case a 40 year old male. This couple has two children
(`RELATE==3`) and the husband's mother (`RELATE==6`), also living in the
household.

#### Non-institutional group-quarters
We can contrast that fairly "nuclear family" household with a
non-institutional group-quarters housing unit in Oakland:

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "An example group quarters unit with income data"
#| code-fold: true
#| label: tbl-example-gq
household_serials <- oak %>%
  filter(GQ == 5) %>%
  pull(SERIAL)
set.seed(6)
sample_household <- sample(household_serials, 1)
sampled_data <- oak %>% 
  filter(SERIAL == sample_household) %>% 
  select(SERIAL, PUMA, GQ, PERNUM, RELATE, AGE, SEX, HHINCOME, INCTOT)
sampled_data
```

We see that there is a head-of-household, a 26 year old male, but all 10
other housing unit members are "partners, friends, \[or\] visitors"
(`RELATE==11`). These are largely adults with earnings, so this group
quarters unit would have a very high "household income" and bias the estimated median income up were it included
for that calculation.

#### Institutional housing units
Group quarters also include institutional housing units, such as
correctional facilities.

```{r}
#| tbl-cap: "An example institutional housing unit with income data"
#| code-fold: true
#| label: tbl-example-ih
household_serials <- oak %>%
  filter(GQ == 3) %>%
  pull(SERIAL)
set.seed(1)
sample_household <- sample(household_serials, 1)
sampled_data <- oak %>% 
  filter(SERIAL == sample_household) %>% 
  select(SERIAL, PUMA, GQ, PERNUM, RELATE, AGE, SEX, HHINCOME, INCTOT)
sampled_data
```

This housing unit only includes one member, an 86 year old woman who is
an "institutional inmate" (`RELATE==13`) with no income. This unit would likely bias median household income down, were it included.

### Household Income in the ACS

Let's return to the motivating question:  

::: {.callout-tip}
## Motivating Question
**What was the median household
income in Oakland, California in 2022?**  
:::  

Note the income
variables we observe for this family:

1.  `INCTOT` reports each respondent's total pre-tax personal income or
    losses from all sources for the previous year. `9999999` is code to
    denote that the value is missing, which makes sense given that the
    missing values above correspond to children in the household [See
    [INCTOT](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/INCTOT) in
    @ruggles_ipums_2024].

2.  `HHINCOME` reports the total money income of all household members
    age 15+ during the previous year. The amount should equal the sum of
    all household members' individual incomes, as recorded in the
    person-record variable INCTOT [See
    [HHINCOME](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/HHINCOME) in
    @ruggles_ipums_2024]

Given what we know about the unique identifier for households, and the
`HHINCOME` variable, we can construct the appropriate dataset for
answering our motivating question – every household in Oakland that had
household income.

```{r}
households_w_income <- households %>%
  filter(
    HHINCOME != 9999999,
    HHINCOME >= 0,
    )
```

It seems we can proceed to simply calculate the median of the `HHINCOME`
column? Not so fast... Data in the ACS microdata are not what they seem.
Before we do any analysis, we have to account for **sample weights**.

## Step 4: Applying sample weights {#sec-step-4}

Let's return to our sample family from above, but also examine the
variables `PERWT` and `HHWT`.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-example-hh-weights
#| tbl-cap: "An example household with weight data"
oak %>% filter(SERIAL == sample_household_true) %>% 
  select(c(AGE, SEX, HHINCOME, INCTOT, PERWT, HHWT))
```

These are the two primary sample weights in ACS microdata, and they can
be interpreted fairly directly.

-   `PERWT` gives the population represented by each individual in the
    sample, thus in the first row of the sample household, the 41 year
    old woman with an individual income of \$104,500 represents 51
    individuals in the PUMA.
-   `HHWT` gives the number of households in the general population
    represented by each household in the sample, thus this household is
    representative of 51 households in that PUMA.

Any analysis or visualization of ACS microdata should be weighted by
`PERWT` for work at the person-level, and `HHWT` for the household-level
[See [Sample Weights](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/intro.shtml#weights) in
@ruggles_ipums_2024].

For visualizations, we pass the weights to the plotting API. For
example, in `ggplot` many chart types support a `weight` argument.

```{r fig.asp = .5}
#| fig-cap: "Household Income Distribution in Oakland (with household weights)"
ggplot(households_w_income, aes(x = HHINCOME, weight = HHWT)) +
  geom_histogram(
    binwidth = 50000,
    fill = "lightblue",
    alpha = 1,
    color = "grey"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(
    labels = scales::label_currency(scale_cut = scales::cut_short_scale()),
    breaks = seq(0, 1600000, 200000)
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::label_comma()) +
  labs(x = "Household Income", y = "Number of Households")
```

For analysis, we use the
[`srvyr`](http://gdfe.co/srvyr/reference/index.html) package to define
the survey weights before using them to calculate statistics. For
example, here we'll finally address the motivating question.  

::: {.callout-tip}
## Motivating Question
**What was the median household
income in Oakland, California in 2022?**  
:::

The answer, as measured in the IPUMS
microdata is as follows:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-answer
#| tbl-cap: "2022 Median Household Income in Oakland, CA"
households_w_income %>%
  as_survey(weights=HHWT) %>%
  summarise(weighted_median = survey_median(HHINCOME)) %>% 
  select(weighted_median)
```

Let's do a quick comparison of our IPUMS results to the aggregate census
data we retrieved in the first section. Here are our full IPUMS results
for both median household income and population:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| label: tbl-ipums-res
#| tbl-cap: "IPUMS versus ACS aggregate results"
median_table <- households_w_income %>%
  as_survey(weights=HHWT) %>% 
  summarise(weighted_median = survey_median(HHINCOME)) %>% 
  mutate(variable = "median_hh_income",
         ipums_estimate = weighted_median,
         se = weighted_median_se)

count_table <- oak %>%
  as_survey(weights=PERWT) %>% 
  survey_count() %>% 
  mutate(variable = "total_pop",
         ipums_estimate = n,
         se = n_se)

aggregate_data <- oakland_stats %>%
  select(c(variable, estimate)) %>%
  rename(ACS_aggregate_estimate = estimate)

bind_rows(count_table, median_table) %>% 
  select(c(variable, ipums_estimate)) %>% inner_join(aggregate_data, by='variable')

```

These are clearly different. What gives? Unfortunately, **summary
statistics calculated using IPUMS data typically cannot match aggregate
ACS figures!**

One major reason for this gap is additional sampling error. Recall that
the American Community Survey is a sample. A given one-year ACS is
typically a 1% sample of the U.S. population, with associated sampling
error. When the census makes microdata available, they create a sample
of that sample -- we do not get the full 1%. This second sampling
process introduces further sampling error in the microdata that is not
reflected in figures sourced from aggregate ACS data, which are
calculated using the full ACS sample [[See
ACS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/chapter2/chapter2.shtml#ACS) in
@ruggles_ipums_2024].

## Step 5: Calculating standard errors {#sec-step-5}

Now we have estimates derived from the ACS microdata, but how do we
communicate uncertainty around those estimates? For the sake of this
example, let's explore the problem of standard errors via a slightly
different motivating question -- **what was the average household income
in Oakland in 2022**?

I'm switching to the average because we are about to calculate some
standard errors from-scratch, and that's much more clear-cut for linear
statistics like the average than for non-linear statistics like the
median. We will return to the median at the end of this section, but
rely on a package implementation and not do anything from-scratch.

Anyways, let's calculate the average household income in Oakland using
the sample household weights. The [formula for the weighted
average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Mathematical_definition)
is: $$
\bar{X}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_ix_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_i}
$$ We'll put that into code and get the following estimate of the
average household income in Oakland:

```{r}
weighted_mean <- (
  sum(households_w_income$HHINCOME * households_w_income$HHWT)
  / sum(households_w_income$HHWT)
  )
weighted_mean
```

Now, let's get a standard error for that estimate. Correctly utilizing
the sample weights in the variance calculation is [a little
tricky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Variance)
and there are a few different approaches to the problem. I'll cover two
techniques for variance estimation: the Taylor series method (also
referred to as "linearized variance" or Taylor series linearization) and
replication weights. Each of these are implemented in the `survey`
package [@lumley_analysis_2004].

### The Taylor series method

Most packages (e.g.
[SAS](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/statug/latest/statug_surveymeans_details06.htm#statug.surveymeans.variancedetails),
[Stata](https://www.stata.com/manuals/svyvarianceestimation.pdf), and
R's [`survey`
package](https://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/#:~:text=Variances%20by%20Taylor%20linearization))
default to using the Taylor series method for variance estimation of
weighted statistics. This is because weighted statistics, like the
average above, are not linear with respect to the weights, making
analytical calculation of the variance difficult or else undefined
[@lohr_sampling_2021]. The Taylor series method entails calculating the
first-order linear approximation of the statistic (e.g. the linear
approximation of the weighted mean formula above), then finding the
variance of that approximation. The details of those calculations are
beyond the scope of this post, but [@lohr_sampling_2021, chap 9.1]
covers the process in detail, and Wikipedia has a nice
[walkthrough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_arithmetic_mean#Variance_of_the_weighted_mean_(%CF%80-estimator_for_ratio-mean))
as well. We will just work with the formula for linearized variance that
is arrived at in the Wikipedia post:

$$
\hat{\text{Var}}(\bar{X}_w) = \frac{\sum w_i^2 (x_i - \bar{X}_w)^2}{\left(\sum w_i\right)^2} 
$$ The standard error is just the square root of that variance.\
$$
\hat{\text{SE}}(\bar{X}_w) = \sqrt{\hat{\text{Var}}(\bar{X}_w)}
$$ We'll code that up in R:

```{r}
numerator <- sum(households_w_income$HHWT^2 * (households_w_income$HHINCOME - weighted_mean)^2)
denominator <- sum(households_w_income$HHWT)^2
variance <- numerator / denominator
se <- sqrt(variance)
se
```

That result is a usable estimate for the standard error of the average
household income in Oakland. Of course in practice we would always use a
package, in this case `survey`, for calculating that. Here I'll
calculate the average household income in Oakland using `survey`, and it
will default to returning a standard error via the Taylor series method.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-wrong-se
#| tbl-cap: "Taylor Series Method Standard Error"
households_w_income %>%
  as_survey(weights=HHWT) %>%
  summarise(weighted_mean = survey_mean(HHINCOME))

```

This standard error is off from ours by about \$1, which could be due to
other corrections applied in the package's variance calculation. We
needn't be too worried about this discrepancy, though. While the Taylor
series method is popular in survey analysis, [IPUMS
recommends](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/repwt.shtml) that we use the
replication weights method when working with ACS microdata.

### Replication weights

In theory, the [standard
error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error) of an estimate
measures the variation of a statistic across multiple samples from a
given population. Our sample standard error above, calculated using just
the one sample, is an estimate of that theoretical standard error.

Replicate methods operate under the assumption that one sample can be
conceived of as a miniature version of the population. Instead of taking
multiple samples from the population to construct a variance estimator,
one may simply resample from the full, original sample to mimic the
theoretical basis of standard errors [@lohr_sampling_2021, chap 9.1].

In practice, we don't explicitly do any resampling, instead relying on
"replicate weights" that the census pre-computes. Here we can see what
replicate weights (in this case, household replicate weights) look like
in our data. Each of `REPWT`, 1 through 80, is a set of alternative
household weights, slightly different from the "production weight,"
`HHWT`.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-rep-weights
#| tbl-cap: "ACS Replicate Household Weights"
households_w_income %>%
  mutate(` ` = "...") %>% 
  select(c(HHINCOME, HHWT, REPWT1, REPWT2, ` `, REPWT79, REPWT80)) %>% 
  head()
```

We can use replicate weights in a variety of alternative variance
estimates. In the IPUMS documentation on ACS replicate weights, they
outline a [variance estimation
procedure](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/repwt.shtml#:~:text=can%20change%20substantially.-,HOW%20DO%20I%20OBTAIN%20REPLICATE%20STANDARD%20ERRORS%20FROM%20IPUMS%2DUSA%20DATA%3F,-There%20are%203)
that matches the "successive difference replication (SDR) variance"
method. We obtain SDR variance by calculating our statistic of interest
with the production weights (e.g. `HHWT`) as follows:\
$$
\bar{X}_w = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\text{HHWT}_ix_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\text{HHWT}_i}
$$

Then, for each of the 80 household replicate weights (e.g. `REPWT1`), we
calculate the weighted average income using the replicate weight\
$$
\bar{X}_r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\text{REPWT}_{ri}x_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\text{REPWT}_{ri}}
$$ and sum the squared deviations between that "replicate-weighted"
estimate, $\bar{X}_r$, and the production weighted estimate.
Specifically: $$
\begin{align*}
\hat{\text{Var}}(\bar{X}_w) &= \frac{4}{80} \sum_{r=1}^{80} (\bar{X}_r - \bar{X}_w)^2
\end{align*}
$$

[@fay_aspects_1995] initially proposed that variance estimator and
[their
paper](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/working-papers/1995/demo/faytrain95.pdf)
gives the full derivation. The standard error is once again just the
square root of that variance.

$$
\hat{\text{SE}}(\bar{X}_w) = \sqrt{\hat{\text{Var}}(\bar{X}_w)}
$$ In code, calculated via a for-loop, we'd get the following:

```{r}
# Calculate X_r
X_r <- vector()
for (r in 1:80){
  X_r[r] <- households_w_income %>%
    as_survey(weights=glue("REPWT", r)) %>%
    summarise(weighted_mean = survey_mean(HHINCOME)) %>% 
    .$weighted_mean
}
# Calculate X
X <- households_w_income %>%
    as_survey(weights=HHWT) %>%
    summarise(weighted_mean = survey_mean(HHINCOME)) %>% 
    .$weighted_mean

# Sum over r
sqrt( (4/80) * sum( (X_r - X)^2 ) )
```

To be clear, we don't do that manually in practice -- `survey` supports
specifying survey designs with replicate weights. The following is an
implementation of the same standard error calculation procedure. Note
the identical output.

```{r}
households_w_income %>% 
  as_survey_rep(
  weight = HHWT ,
  repweights = matches("REPWT[0-9]+"),
  type = "successive-difference",
  mse = TRUE) %>%
  summarise(weighted_mean = survey_mean(HHINCOME))
```

There are a few different replicate methods for variance estimation,
several of which are equivalent. For example, the successive-difference
standard error above is equivalent to using [Fay's Balanced Repeated
Replication
method](https://documentation.sas.com/doc/en/statug/15.2/statug_surveyphreg_details29.htm)
with the Faye coefficient set to $\epsilon=.5$.

```{r}
households_w_income %>% 
  as_survey_rep(
  weight = HHWT ,
  repweights = matches("REPWT[0-9]+"),
  type = "Fay",
  rho=.5,
  mse = TRUE) %>%
  summarise(weighted_mean = survey_mean(HHINCOME))
```

IPUMS' documentation [recommends](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/repwt.shtml)
the following specification, where the replicate method is set to "ACS."
This has the same output as the previous two specifications, and is
presumably implementing SDR variance.

```{r}
households_w_income %>% 
as_survey_rep(
  weight = HHWT,
  repweights = matches("REPWT[0-9]+"),
  type = "ACS",
  mse = TRUE) %>%
  summarise(weighted_mean = survey_mean(HHINCOME))
```

Now that we have the methods established, we'll return to the median,
rather than the mean, household income. Some of the above formulas would
be different for the median, but the code and package implementations
are the same. Here we will calculate the median household income in
Oakland, and the standard error for that statistic using three methods:

1.  ACS aggregate data retrieval
2.  Estimation via IPUMS microdata with Taylor series variance/standard
    error
3.  Estimation via IPUMS microdata with replicate weight
    variance/standard error

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
df1 <- oakland_stats %>% 
  mutate(`Standard Error` = moe/1.645, Method = 'Aggregate Data') %>%
  filter(variable == 'median_hh_income') %>% 
  select(c(Method, estimate, `Standard Error`)) %>% 
  rename(`Weighted Median HH Income` = estimate)
df2 <- households_w_income %>% 
as_survey(
  weights = HHWT) %>%
  summarise(`Weighted Median HH Income` = survey_median(HHINCOME)) %>% 
  rename(`Standard Error` = `Weighted Median HH Income_se`) %>% 
  mutate(Method = 'Microdata w/ Taylor Series Method') %>% 
  select(c(Method, `Weighted Median HH Income`, `Standard Error`))
df3 <- households_w_income %>% 
as_survey_rep(
  weight = HHWT,
  repweights = matches("REPWT[0-9]+"),
  type = "ACS",
  mse = TRUE) %>%
  summarise(`Weighted Median HH Income` = survey_median(HHINCOME)) %>% 
  rename(`Standard Error` = `Weighted Median HH Income_se`) %>% 
  mutate(Method = 'Microdata w/ Replicate Weights') %>% 
  select(c(Method, `Weighted Median HH Income`, `Standard Error`))

combined_df <- bind_rows(df1, df2, df3)
combined_df
```

In IPUMS testing of ACS/PRCS data, replicate weights usually increase
standard errors, though in our case the replicate weights produced a
slightly smaller standard error than the Taylor series method.

## A Production Workflow

Putting all of this post together, here is production code that I would
use to build a dataset for analyzing household-level variables in
Oakland, leaning on the IPUMS and geocorr helper functions I defined
above, and specifying replicate weights and "ACS" variance.

```{r}
#| output: false
# Get the IPUMS data for California
data <- ipums_data("us2022a", variables, "Incomes by PUMA")
# Find the geographic correspondence for places -> pumas
csv_data <- geocorr_2022("Ca06", "puma22", "place", "pop20")
# isolate pumas that correspond to oakland and have oak population
oak_pumas <- csv_data %>%
  select(-c(state, stab, place, PUMA22name)) %>%
  filter(PlaceName == 'Oakland city, CA', afact > 0) %>% 
  pull(puma22) %>% 
  as.integer()
# Filter the IPUMS data to those pumas
oak_hh_w_inc <- data %>%
  filter(PUMA %in% oak_pumas) %>% 
  distinct(SAMPLE, SERIAL, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  filter(HHINCOME != 9999999, HHINCOME > 0) %>% 
  haven::zap_labels()
# convert the IPUMS data to a survey dataset
oak_hh_inc_svy <- households_w_income %>% 
  as_survey_rep(
    weight = HHWT,
    repweights = matches("REPWT[0-9]+"),
    type = "ACS",
    mse = TRUE)
```

And here is the median household income.

```{r}
oak_hh_inc_svy %>%
  summarise(median_hh_inc = survey_median(HHINCOME))
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(reticulate)
use_condaenv('base')
```

```{python}
#| output: false
#| echo: false
#| 
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

df = pd.DataFrame(r['oak_hh_w_inc'])

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3, 3))
sns.kdeplot(data=df, x='HHINCOME', weights="HHWT", ax=ax, fill=True, alpha=.5, log_scale=True, legend=False, cmap="coolwarm")
ax.set_axis_off()
ax.set_xlim(8e2, 10e6)
#ax.set_xlim(-1, 1e6)
fig.tight_layout()
fig.savefig("thumbnail.png", dpi=300)
plt.show();
```
