The folllwing are some notes on using integration for finding cumulative probability distribution functions in the univariate and joint/multivariate settings. The exercises and citation are all coming out of a textbook for a course in vector calculus [@strang_calculus_2016-1]. I wrote this out because:  

1. I always forget how to calculate integrals and wanted to make some notes on a basic application of [$u$ subsitition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution) and the mechanics of multiple integration over general regions, and  

2. I think this application area, modeling waiting times, is interesting and relevant for policy analysis

### Modeling a single waiting time

Consider the following question:

> At a drive-thru restaurant, customers spend, on average, 3 minutes
> placing their orders \[...\] find the probability that customers spend
> 6 minutes or less placing their order. \[...\] Waiting times are
> mathematically modeled by exponential density functions.
>
> -- [@strang_calculus_2016-1, chapter 5.2]

To model this and calculate our target quantity, we'll start by referring
to the process of placing one's order as a random variable, $X$. We will
model that random variable using an exponential probability density
function (pdf):
$$
f(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\beta} e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}} \quad &x \geq 0 \\
0 \quad &x < 0 
\end{cases}
$$  

Where $\beta$ is the average waiting time [@strang_calculus_2016-1, chapter 5.2].

We set the equation up in `R` and plot it so that we can understand what
it represents.

```{r}
P_x <- function(x, beta=3) {
  case_when(x < 0 ~ 0,
            x >= 0 ~ (1/beta) * exp(-x/beta)
            )
}

```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| fig-height: 3
#| warning: false
data <- data.frame(x = x_vec, y = P_x(x_vec))
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point(color = "royalblue", size=3.2) +
  geom_line(color = "royalblue", size=1.2) +
  labs(x = "x (Minutes)", y = "f(x)", title = "An exponential probability density function (pdf)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

At each $x$, this function outputs the probability that it takes $x$
minutes placing an order in the drive-thru. For example, the probability
that it takes exactly six minutes to place an order is as follows:

```{r}
P_x(6)
```

That's what a pdf gives us and that's cool. However, our question asks
for the probability that it takes *less than or equal to six minutes to order*. That
involves adding up all of the probabilities for times $[0,6]$ over this
continuous function -- sounds like an integral. Indeed, we'll need to
integrate over the following region:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
plot_ly(
  x = x_vec,
  y = P_x(x_vec),
  type = "scatter",
  mode="line",
  name = "P(x)") %>% add_trace(
    x = 0:6,
    y = P_x(0:6, 3),
    type = "scatter",
    mode="none",
    fill = "tozeroy",
    name = "P(x) <= 6"
) %>% 
  layout(plot_bgcolor = "#e5ecf6", shapes = list(vline(6))
         )
```

We'll compute that integral by hand because why not -- it's a good
refresher on $u$ substitution.
$$
\begin{align*}
P(X \leq 6) &= \int_0 ^6 f(x)dx \\
&= \int_0 ^6 \frac{1}{\beta} e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}dx \\
\text{Substitute}\, u &= -\frac{x}{\beta} \\
\text{And substitute}\, dx \rightarrow \, \frac{du}{dx} &= -\frac{1}{\beta} \rightarrow dx = -\beta du \\
P(X \leq 6) &= \int_0 ^6 \frac{1}{\beta} e^u (-\beta du) \\
 &= -1\int_0 ^6  e^u du \\
&= - e^u \Big|_0^6 \\
P(X \leq 6) &= - e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}} \Big|_0^6 \\
\end{align*}
$$

The last line gives us the following algebra:
$- e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}} \Big|_0^6 = - e^{-\frac{6}{3}} - (- e^{-\frac{0}{3}}) = 1 - e^{-\frac{6}{3}}$
Leading us to our answer:

```{r}
(-exp(-6/3)) + 1
```

Which is the probability that it takes six minutes or less to order in
this drive-thru.

### Cumulative Probability

When we derived the indefinite integral,
$\int \frac{1}{\beta} e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}dx = - e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}}$,
in the process of solving our definite integral problem, we actually
derived another useful function – the cumulative distribution function (cdf).
The cumulative distribution function describes the probability that $x$ is some number, say $a$, or less, and it is generally the integral of the
probability density function [@noauthor_cumulative_2024]. In the case of the exponential function,
it is as follows:

$$
F(a) = P(x \leq a) = \int_0^a P(x)dx =- e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}} \Big|_0^a
$$

Or, in code:

```{r}
cdf_x <- function(x, beta=3){
  -1 * exp(-x/beta)
}
```

We'll confirm that $F(6) = e^{-\frac{x}{\beta}} \Big|_0^6$

```{r}
1 + cdf_x(6)
```

Here are the pdf and cdf functions plotted together for the exponential
distribution with an average of 3 ($\beta=3$). At each point on the
orange line (the pdf), you can hover over and find out the probability
that the drive-thru takes exactly $x$ minutes, whereas on the blue line
(the cdf), you'll find the probability that the drive-thru takes less
than or equal to $x$ minutes.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
plot_ly(
  x = x_vec,
  y = 1 + cdf_x(x_vec),
  type = "scatter",
  mode="lines+markers",
  name = "CDF: F(a)") %>% 
  add_trace(
    x = x_vec,
    y = P_x(x_vec),
    type = "scatter",
    mode="lines+markers",
    name = "PDF: P(x)"
)
```

### Modeling multiple waiting times

Since we are given two random variables and asked to find the
probability of an event where something specific happens to each one, we
can conceive of this problem using a joint density function. We are given
that these two waiting times are independent (not correlated), so we can
model joint density as follows:

> The variables $X$ and $Y$ are said to be independent random variables
> if their joint density function is the product of their individual
> density functions: $$
> f(x, y) = f_1(x)f_2(y)
> $$
>
> -- [@strang_calculus_2016-1, chapter 5.2]

The two functions given in the problem are:  

1. an exponential density function with mean 15 (waiting for the table)  

$$
f_1(x) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{15} e^{-\frac{x}{15}} \quad &x \geq 0 \\
0 \quad &x < 0 
\end{cases}
$$  

2. an exponential density function with mean 40 (eating at the table)  

$$
f_2(y) = \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{40} e^{-\frac{y}{40}} \quad &y \geq 0 \\
0 \quad &y < 0 
\end{cases}
$$  

This gives us the joint density function:

$$
\begin{align*}
f(x, y) &= f_1(x)f_2(y) \\
&= \left[\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{40} e^{-\frac{x}{40}} \quad &x \geq 0 \\
0 \quad &x < 0 
\end{cases} \right] \times \left[ \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{15} e^{-\frac{y}{15}} \quad &y \geq 0 \\
0 \quad &y < 0 
\end{cases} \right] \\
&= 
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{600} e^{-\frac{x}{40}}e^{-\frac{y}{15}} \quad &x,y \geq 0 \\
0 \quad &x < 0 \,\text{or}\, y < 0 
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$${#eq-syd}

We can set that up in code as well

```{r}
pdf_function <- function(x, y) {
  table_wait <- P_x(x, 15)
  eating_time <- P_x(y, 40)
  total_time <- table_wait * eating_time
  return(total_time)
}
```

This function allows us to find the probability of our table wait +
eating time being a specific amount of minutes. For example, what's the
probability that it takes us 15 minutes to secure a table and 40 minutes
to eat?

```{r}
pdf_function(15, 40)
```

This is a really small number, which makes some level of intuitive sense
-- it seems remote that the whole restaurant experience will take
exactly 55 minutes, no more no less.

Now, returning to the question -- we want to find the probability that
the whole restaurant experience (waiting for a table and eating) takes
an hour and a half (90 minutes) or less. Again, we'll need to add up all of the probabilities from 0 to 90 minutes, implying that we will solve this with an integral. However, we are in a multivariate setting, so this will require multiple integration.  

To set up the problem, we'll plot the joint density function, the $xy$ plane, and this 90 minute constraint.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| code-fold: true

scene <- list(
  camera = list(eye = list(
    x = 2, y = 1.1, z = 1.2
  )),
  xaxis = list(title = "X"),
  yaxis = list(title = "Y"),
  zaxis = list(title = "P(X,Y)")
)
# Define range for x and y
x_range <- seq(0, 50, length.out = 100)
y_range <- seq(0, 50, length.out = 100)
xy_grid <- expand.grid(x = x_range, y = y_range)

z_values <- pdf_function(xy_grid$x, xy_grid$y)
z_plane <- rep(0, nrow(xy_grid))

# x y constraint
x_range_constraint <- seq(40, 50, length.out = 100)
y_constraint <- 90 - x_range_constraint
xy_constraint_grid <- expand.grid(x = x_range_constraint, y = y_constraint)
z_constraint <- rep(0, nrow(xy_grid))


# Reshape z values to create a matrix for plotting
z_matrix <- matrix(z_values, nrow = length(x_range), ncol = length(y_range))
z_constraint_matrix <- matrix(z_constraint, nrow = length(x_range), ncol = length(y_constraint))
z_plane_matrix <- matrix(z_plane, nrow = length(x_range), ncol = length(y_range))


# Create 3D plot using plot_ly
plot_ly(x = x_range, y = y_range, z = z_plane_matrix, type = "surface") %>% hide_colorbar() %>%
  add_trace(
    x = x_range,
    y = y_range,
    z = z_matrix,
    type = "surface",
    colorscale = "Cividis",
    colorbar = list(title = "P(X,Y)")
  ) %>%
  add_trace(
    x = x_range_constraint,
    y = y_constraint,
    z = 0,
    type = "scatter3d",
    name = "X + Y <= 90",
    mode="lines+markers"
  ) %>% layout(scene = scene)

```  

Let's first define a region of integration, $D$. We are given $x+y \leq 90$, and given that we are talking about minutes, which are bounded $[0, \infty)$, we can make that $0 \leq x+y \leq 90$. With some algebraic manipulation, we can define the region as:  
$$
D = \{(x,y) \,|\, 0 \leq x \leq90, 0 \leq y \leq 90-x  \}
$$

Setting that up as a definite integral, we get the following:  
$$
P(X+Y \leq 90) = P( (X,Y) \in D) = \iint_D f(x,y) dA
$$

Given that there is no density for this function when $x$ or $y$ is less than zero, we can ignore the piece wise structure of the joint pdf and set up the integral using only the portion that defines the function on the domain $x \in [0, \infty)$. This gives us:

$$
\begin{align*}
&= \int_0^{90} \int_0^{90-x} \frac{1}{600} e^{-\frac{x}{40}}e^{-\frac{y}{15}} dydx \\
&= \frac{1}{600} \int_0^{90} \int_0^{90-x} e^{-\frac{x}{40}-\frac{y}{15}} dydx
\end{align*}
$$  

Computing this integral is difficult, but we'll walk through it. We will again use $u$ substitution.

$$
\begin{align*}
u &= -\frac{x}{40}-\frac{y}{15} \\
\frac{du}{dy} &= -\frac{1}{15} \rightarrow dy=-15du\\
\end{align*}
$$
We can plug that in to finish the first integral:  
$$
\begin{align*}
&= \frac{1}{600}\int_0^{90} \int_0^{90-x} e^{u} (-15)dudx \\
&= \frac{-15}{600}\int_0^{90} \int_0^{90-x} e^{u} dudx \\
&= \frac{-15}{600}\int_0^{90} e^{u} \Big|_0^{90-x}  dx \\
&= \frac{-15}{600}\int_0^{90} e^{-\frac{x}{40}-\frac{y}{15}} \Big|_0^{90-x}  dx \\
&= \frac{-15}{600}\int_0^{90} e^{-\frac{x}{40}-\frac{90-x}{15}} - e^{-\frac{x}{40}-\frac{0}{15}}  dx \\
&= \frac{-15}{600}\int_0^{90} e^{-\frac{3x}{120}-\frac{8(90-x)}{120}} - e^{-\frac{x}{40}}dx \\
&= \frac{-15}{600}\int_0^{90} e^{\frac{-3x-720+8x}{120}} - e^{-\frac{x}{40}}dx \\
&= \frac{-15}{600}\int_0^{90} e^{\frac{5x-720}{120}} - e^{-\frac{x}{40}}dx \\
&= \frac{-15}{600}\int_0^{90} e^{\frac{x}{24}-6} - e^{-\frac{x}{40}}dx
\end{align*}
$$

That was pretty difficult! Now we can continue on to the second integral and split it into two:  

$$
\begin{align*}
&= \frac{-15}{600} \left[ \int_0^{90} e^{\frac{x}{24}-6}dx - \int_0^{90} e^{-\frac{x}{40}}dx \right]
\end{align*}
$$  

We'll solve these integrals with $u$ and $v$ substitution, with our terms defined as follows:  

$$
\begin{align*}
u &= \frac{x}{24}-6 \\
\frac{du}{dx} &= \frac{1}{24} \rightarrow dx=24du\\
v &= -\frac{x}{40} \\
\frac{dv}{dx} &= -\frac{1}{40} \rightarrow dx=-40dv\\
\end{align*}
$$  
When we plug these terms back in, we can finally compute the definite integral.

$$
\begin{align*}
&= \frac{-15}{600} \left[ 24 \int_0^{90} e^{u}du + 40\int_0^{90} e^v dv \right] \\ 
&= \frac{-15}{600} \left[ 24 e^{u}\Big|_0^{90} + 40 e^v \Big|_0^{90} \right] \\
&= \frac{-15}{600} \left[ 24 e^{\frac{x}{24}-6}\Big|_0^{90} + 40 e^{-\frac{x}{40}}\Big|_0^{90} \right] \\
&= \frac{-15}{600} \left[24(e^{\frac{90}{24}-6} - e^{\frac{0}{24}-6}) + 40(e^{-\frac{90}{40}}-e^{-\frac{0}{40}}) \right] \\
&= \frac{-15}{600} \left[24(e^{-2.25} - e^{-6}) + 40(e^{-2.25}-1) \right] \\
&= \frac{-15}{600} \left[ -33.3139396802807 \right] \\
&= 0.832848492007017
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, the probability that the total experience is 90 minutes or less is about 83%.  

### Deriving a generalizable approach
Let's look at another problem, but now, instead of solving just one specific problem, we'll derive an equation that can easily solve any question structured like this so that don't have to do so many integrals...  

>[...] At a drive-thru restaurant, customers spend, on average, 3 minutes placing their orders and an additional 5 minutes paying for and picking up their meals. Assume that placing the order and paying for/picking up the meal are two independent events $X$ and $Y$. If the waiting times are modeled by the exponential probability densities. Find $P[X+Y \leq 6]$  and interpret the result.
>
> -- [@strang_calculus_2016-1, chapter 5.2] - Question 119

We'll again set up the joint density function:
$$
\begin{align*}
f(x, y) &= f_1(x)f_2(y) \\
&= \left[\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{3} e^{-\frac{x}{3}} \quad &x \geq 0 \\
0 \quad &x < 0 
\end{cases} \right] \times \left[ \begin{cases}
\frac{1}{5} e^{-\frac{y}{5}} \quad &y \geq 0 \\
0 \quad &y < 0 
\end{cases} \right] \\
&= 
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{15} e^{-\frac{x}{3}}e^{-\frac{y}{5}} \quad &x,y \geq 0 \\
0 \quad &x < 0 \,\text{or}\, y < 0 
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
$$
and the region of integration appropriate for answering the question:  
$$
D = \{(x,y) \,|\, 0 \leq x \leq6, 0 \leq y \leq 6-x  \}
$$
This leaves us with the integral:
$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{15} \int_0^{6} \int_0^{6-x} e^{-\frac{x}{3}-\frac{y}{5}} dydx
\end{align*}
$$

However, rather than solve this specifically, lets take the opportunity to derive a more general solution that can give us the target probability for **any question phrased like this.**  

We'll replace all the specific values:  

- 3, which is the average amount of minutes in the drive-thru, with $\beta_1$,  
- 5, which is the average amount of minutes spent ordering, with $\beta_2$, and  
- 6, which is the maximum number of minutes for the whole experience, with $c$.    


That gives us: 
$$
\begin{align*}
&= \frac{1}{\beta_1\beta_2} \int_0^{c} \int_0^{c-x} e^{-\frac{x}{\beta_1}-\frac{y}{\beta_2}} dydx
\end{align*}
$$
We proceed to solve the quite painful integral one more time. We'll start with $u$ substitution:  
$$
\begin{align*}
u &= -\frac{x}{\beta_1}-\frac{y}{\beta_2} \\
\frac{du}{dy} &= -\frac{1}{\beta_2} \rightarrow dy=-\beta_2du\\
\end{align*}
$$  

And plug those in to solve the first definite integral:

$$
\begin{align*}
&= \frac{-1}{\beta_1} \int_0^{c} \int_0^{c-x} e^{u} dudx \\
&= \frac{-1}{\beta_1}\int_0^{c} e^{-\frac{x}{\beta_1}-\frac{y}{\beta_2}} \Big|_0^{c-x}  dx \\
&= \frac{-1}{\beta_1}\int_0^{c} e^{-\frac{x}{\beta_1}-\frac{c-x}{\beta_2}} - e^{-\frac{x}{\beta_1}-\frac{0}{\beta_2}}  dx \\
&= \frac{-1}{\beta_1}\int_0^{c} e^{-\frac{\beta_2x}{\beta_1\beta_2}-\frac{\beta_1(c-x)}{\beta_1\beta_2}} - e^{-\frac{x}{\beta_1}}dx \\
&= \frac{-1}{\beta_1}\int_0^{c} e^{\frac{-\beta_2x - \beta_1c+\beta_1x}{\beta_1\beta_2}} - e^{-\frac{x}{\beta_1}}dx \\
&= \frac{-1}{\beta_1} \left[ \int_0^{c} e^{\frac{(\beta_1-\beta_2)x - \beta_1c}{\beta_1\beta_2}}dx - \int_0^{c} e^{-\frac{x}{\beta_1}}dx \right] \\
\end{align*}
$$
Now we'll use $u$ and $v$ substitution to solve the last definite integral:

$$
\begin{align*}
u &= \frac{(\beta_1-\beta_2)x - \beta_1c}{\beta_1\beta_2} \\
\frac{du}{dx} &= \frac{(\beta_1-\beta_2)}{\beta_1\beta_2} \rightarrow dx=\frac{\beta_1\beta_2}{(\beta_1-\beta_2)}du\\
v &= -\frac{x}{\beta_1} \\
\frac{dv}{dx} &= -\frac{1}{\beta_1} \rightarrow dx=-\beta_1dv\\
\end{align*}
$$  

Plugging those in, we arrive at a general function of $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$, and $c$.

$$
\begin{align*}
&= \frac{-1}{\beta_1} \left[ \int_0^{c} e^{u}\frac{\beta_1\beta_2}{(\beta_1-\beta_2)}du - \int_0^{c} e^{v}(-\beta_1dv) \right] \\ 
&= \frac{-1}{\beta_1} \left[ \frac{\beta_1\beta_2}{(\beta_1-\beta_2)}\int_0^{c} e^{u}du - (-\beta_1)\int_0^{c} e^{v}dv \right] \\ 
&= \frac{-1}{\beta_1} \left[ \frac{\beta_1\beta_2}{(\beta_1-\beta_2)} (e^{\frac{(\beta_1-\beta_2)x - \beta_1c}{\beta_1\beta_2}}\Big|_0^{c}) + \beta_1 (e^{-\frac{x}{\beta_1}}\Big|_0^{c}) \right] \\
&=\left[ \frac{-\beta_2}{(\beta_1-\beta_2)} (e^{\frac{(\beta_1-\beta_2)c - \beta_1c}{\beta_1\beta_2}} - e^{\frac{-\beta_1c}{\beta_1\beta_2}}) - (e^{-\frac{c}{\beta_1}} - e^{-\frac{0}{\beta_1}}) \right] \\ 
&=  \frac{-\beta_2}{(\beta_1-\beta_2)} \left[e^{\frac{(\beta_1-\beta_2)c - \beta_1c}{\beta_1\beta_2}} - e^{\frac{-\beta_1c}{\beta_1\beta_2}}\right] - e^{-\frac{c}{\beta_1}} + 1  \\ 
f(\beta_1, \beta_2, c)&=  \frac{-\beta_2}{(\beta_1-\beta_2)} \left[e^{\frac{-c}{\beta_1}} - e^{\frac{-c}{\beta_2}}\right] - e^{-\frac{c}{\beta_1}} + 1  \\ 
\end{align*}
$$

Now we'll code that equation up in `R` or the calculator of your choice.

```{r}
cdf_wait <- function(beta1, beta2, c) {
  (-beta2/(beta1-beta2)) * 
  (exp((-c)/beta1) - exp((-c)/beta2)) -
  exp((-c)/beta1) + 1 
}
```

Going back to our question -- let's see what's the probability that the drive-thru experience takes 6 minutes or less if waiting to order takes 3 minutes on average and ordering takes 5 minutes on average. We can very easily calculate it with the flexible function $f(\beta_1, \beta_2, c)$ that we just derived:
```{r}
cdf_wait(3, 5, 6)
```
There's a ~45% chance that a customer will spend 6 minutes or less in the drive-thru. We can also use our function, $f(\beta_1, \beta_2, c)$, to easily compute and visualize the probability for any total drive-thru time given these two average times.
```{r}
#| code-fold: true
plot_ly(
  x = x_vec,
  y = cdf_wait(3, 5, x_vec),
  type = "scatter",
  mode="lines+markers",
  name = "CDF: F(a)")
```


And, going back to the first multiple integration question about Sydney's restaurant @eq-syd, we can now answer that with the same function.

```{r}
cdf_wait(15, 40, 90)
```

We again can find the cumulative probability for any waiting time given the average time to get a table (15) and eat (40). 

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
plot_ly(
  x = seq(0, 150),
  y = cdf_wait(15, 40, seq(0, 150)),
  type = "scatter",
  mode="lines+markers",
  name = "CDF: F(a)")
```
