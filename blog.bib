As such, this textbook provides an important opportunity for students to learn the core concepts of calculus and understand how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. The text has been developed to meet the scope and sequence of most general calculus courses. At the same time, the book includes several innovative features designed to enhance student learning. A strength of Calculus Volume 1 is that instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom."--Preface},

The book explores a wide variety of applications and examples, ranging from coincidences and paradoxes to Google PageRank and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Additional application areas explored include genetics, medicine, computer science, and information theory. The authors present the material in an accessible style and motivate concepts using real-world examples. Throughout, they use stories to uncover connections between the fundamental distributions in statistics and conditioning to reduce complicated problems to manageable pieces.The book includes many intuitive explanations, diagrams, and practice problems. Each chapter ends with a section showing how to perform relevant simulations and calculations in R, a free statistical software environment.The second edition adds many new examples, exercises, and explanations, to deepen understanding of the ideas, clarify subtle concepts, and respond to feedback from many students and readers. New supplementary online resources have been developed, including animations and interactive visualizations, and the book has been updated to dovetail with these resources. Supplementary material is available on Joseph Blitzstein’s website www. stat110.net. The supplements include:Solutions to selected exercisesAdditional practice problemsHandouts including review material and sample exams Animations and interactive visualizations created in connection with the edX online version of Stat 110.Links to lecture videos available on ITunes U and YouTube There is also a complete instructor's solutions manual available to instructors who require the book for a course.},

	abstract = {If you want to work in any computational or technical field, you need to understand linear algebra. As the study of matrices and operations acting upon them, linear algebra is the mathematical basis of nearly all algorithms and analyses implemented in computers. But the way it's presented in decades-old textbooks is much different from how professionals use linear algebra today to solve real-world modern applications.  This practical guide from Mike X Cohen teaches the core concepts of linear algebra as implemented in Python, including how they're used in data science, machine learning, deep learning, computational simulations, and biomedical data processing applications. Armed with knowledge from this book, you'll be able to understand, implement, and adapt myriad modern analysis methods and algorithms.  Ideal for practitioners and students using computer technology and algorithms, this book introduces you to: The interpretations and applications of vectors and matrices Matrix arithmetic (various multiplications and transformations) Independence, rank, and inverses Important decompositions used in applied linear algebra (including LU and QR) Eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition Applications including least-squares model fitting and principal components analysis},

	abstract = {An Introduction to Statistical Learning provides an accessible overview of the field of statistical learning, an essential toolset for making sense of the vast and complex data sets that have emerged in fields ranging from biology to finance to marketing to astrophysics in the past twenty years. This book presents some of the most important modeling and prediction techniques, along with relevant applications. Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform.Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.},

The paper reports on two aspects of the estimation problem: 1) variance estimation for the CPS sample estimates, and 2) features of some candidate small area models that might be used to produce the required estimates at the state and county level. The two problems are interrelated: many small area models employ estimated variances for the survey estimates both in the estimation of the small area models and in their evaluation.
